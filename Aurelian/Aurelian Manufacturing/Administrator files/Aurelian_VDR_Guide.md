# Aurelian Manufacturing — Virtual Data Room Guide

## VDR Structure Overview

This is the investor-grade Virtual Data Room for Aurelian Manufacturing's fundraising process across Pre-Seed, Seed, and Series A rounds. The structure follows Nordic/European institutional VC standards.

---

## How This Structure Works

**Folders 00–07** are investor-facing — these are what you share via DocSend, Dropbox, or a dedicated VDR platform. They are numbered in the order investors typically review materials.

**Folder 08** is your internal DD war room — checklists, Q&A prep, investor tracking, and gap analysis. Never shared externally.

**Folder 09** contains your Vedlegg (appendices) and deep-dive research. Shared selectively when investors request supporting evidence.

## Claude Code Integration

This VDR is designed to work directly with Claude Code. From your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the VDR
cd ~/Aurelian_VDR

# Ask Claude Code to work on specific sections
claude "Review the financial folder and identify what's missing for Pre-Seed"
claude "Draft an executive summary based on our pitch deck and financing plan"
claude "Create a Pre-Seed DD checklist and put it in 08_DD_Process_Internal/8.1_Checklists/"
```

The numbered folder structure means Claude Code can navigate intuitively and you always know exactly where things are.
