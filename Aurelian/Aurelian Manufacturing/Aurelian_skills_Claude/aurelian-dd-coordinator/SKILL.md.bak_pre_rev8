# Aurelian Manufacturing — DD Coordinator

Master orchestration skill for investor Due Diligence. This skill routes DD queries to the right specialist skill and maintains overall DD readiness.

## Critical Context

Aurelian Manufacturing is a **pre-revenue** autonomous CNC manufacturing company targeting Q3 2027 production start. All DD materials must reflect pre-revenue status — focus on assumption validation, not historical performance.

**Master financial source:** *02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04) — use this for ALL numbers. No other financial document has authority when it conflicts with master document.

### READ-BEFORE-USE RULE (ABSOLUTE — NO EXCEPTIONS)

> **Claude does NOT have persistent memory.** The values in this skills file are a COPY of master document, not a replacement. You MUST read the original.

**BEFORE producing any DD material with financial figures:**

1. **READ** the master document PDF: `Aurelian_VDR/02_Financial/2.4_Economic_Tables_Projections/02_Economic_Tables_Projections_REV6.pdf`
2. **READ** the design manual: `Design MAnual/aurelian-design-manual.md` (for formatting and styling rules)
3. **VERIFY** values match what you actually read — not what you "remember".
4. **CONFIRM** the 17 checkpoint values from the master document.
5. **If you cannot read master document:** STOP and inform the user.

**This check applies for EACH document request within a conversation — not just the first one.**

### REFERENCE FORMAT FOR GENERATED DOCUMENTS (COPY — DO NOT RECONSTRUCT)

> **Rule: Never hardcode a revision number in generated documents (Word, PPT, PDF).** The master document is always the current revision. When a new revision is issued, all documents remain correct without needing updates. File paths retain the revision in the filename because that is the actual file on disk.

**Full reference:** `*02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04)`
**Inline with section:** `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §[number] (VDR 02.04)`

❌ Never in generated docs: any revision number (e.g. "REV6", "REV7"), or "VDR 02.04" alone without document name
✅ In generated docs: "*02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04)" — NO revision number

**Examples with current values:**
- Revenue 20 CNC @ 60% = ~315 MNOK → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §5.1 (VDR 02.04)`
- Seed: 51.3 MNOK equity + 29.3 MNOK debt = 80.6 MNOK total → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §4.1 (VDR 02.04)`
- Staffing 20 CNC: 16 ops + 4 admin = 20 total → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §1.3b (VDR 02.04)`
- EBIT 20 CNC @ 60% = ~222.3 MNOK → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §3.6 (VDR 02.04)`

## Fundraising Rounds (

| Round | Amount | Pre-Money | Post-Money | Dilution | Target ROI | Status |
|-------|--------|-----------|------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Pre-Seed | 5 MNOK | 25 MNOK | 30 MNOK | 16.7% | ~46.6x | Active |
| Seed | 51.3 MNOK | 130 MNOK | 181.3 MNOK | 28.30% | ~10.8x | Planning |
| Series A | 45 MNOK | 250 MNOK | 295 MNOK | 15.25% | ~7.8x | Future |

**Total equity raised (all rounds):** 101.3 MNOK
**Exit scenario:** 2.3B NOK @ 10x EBITDA
**Founders retain 50.60% at exit** — strong alignment, control maintained throughout.

## Routing Logic

When a DD question arrives, determine the domain and route:

- **Financial questions** (valuation, revenue model, break-even, CAPEX, sensitivities, ROI) → Use `aurelian-financial-model` skill
- **Technical questions** (CNC utilization, autonomous ops, suppliers, facility, technology risk) → Use `aurelian-technical-dd` skill
- **Market questions** (TAM/SAM/SOM, competition, customer pipeline, go-to-market) → Use `aurelian-market-dd` skill
- **Legal/Corporate questions** (cap table, IP, contracts, governance, compliance) → Use `aurelian-legal-dd` skill
- **Customer-facing materials** (pricing, RFQ, capabilities, partnership model) → Use `aurelian-customer` skill
- **Go-to-market execution** (LOIs, pipeline, sales strategy, certifications) → Use `aurelian-gtm` skill
- **General DD coordination** (checklists, readiness, VDR, timeline) → Continue in this skill

## Investor Types & Their DD Focus

| Investor Type | Primary Focus | Depth | Timeline |
|---------------|--------------|-------|----------|
| Pre-Seed Angels | Team, market, concept | Light | 2-4 weeks |
| Seed VC | Market, business model, financials | Medium | 4-8 weeks |
| Series A VC | Financials, operations, scalability | Deep | 8-12 weeks |
| Strategic Corporate | Technology fit, synergy | Very deep | 12-16 weeks |
| Family Office | Team integrity, long-term vision | Medium-deep | 6-10 weeks |

## DD Best Practices

**Before DD starts:** Organize VDR, run internal pre-DD with advisors, fill documentation gaps, prepare top-50 Q&A document, set up secure data room.

**During DD:** Respond within 24 hours, track all questions in a log (question, answer, source doc, responder, date), over-communicate, flag issues proactively, maintain single source of truth.

**After DD:** Debrief on questions asked, update documentation, improve VDR for next round, archive all Q&A.

## Red Flags to Avoid

**Financial:** Overly aggressive projections without justification, unrealistic assumptions, missing sensitivity analyses, unclear use of funds, cap table complexity.

**Technical:** Unproven technology without validation, single supplier dependency without backup, unrealistic timeline, no risk mitigation.

**Team:** Founder conflicts or unclear roles, lack of relevant experience, weak advisory board, high turnover.

**Legal:** Unclear IP ownership, no founder vesting, undocumented material agreements, regulatory gaps.

## Key Messages (Consistent across all DD)

1. **55-65% CNC utilization is the design target** — supported by DMG MORI, MAZAK, and Siemens vendor feasibility data for greenfield autonomous operations. master document models gradual ramp from 20% to 65%.
2. **Sub-linear staffing model** — design target 0.8 FTE/CNC at scale (vs observed industry ~2.5, CNC Benchmark VDR 03.02). Enabled by greenfield design, structurally difficult to retrofit in brownfield.
3. **Pre-revenue by design** — Q3 2027 production target. All projections are forward-looking based on master document model assumptions.
4. **Capital discipline** — Phased investment (5 CNC Seed + 15 CNC Serie A in 3×5 tranches), leased facility, strong CNC resale values (50-70% range).
5. **European positioning** — Addresses same structural need as Hadrian (~$1.6B valuation), with different capital philosophy (101.3 MNOK total planned equity vs $200M+).
6. **Founders retain control** — 50.60% ownership post-Serie A, active board participation.
