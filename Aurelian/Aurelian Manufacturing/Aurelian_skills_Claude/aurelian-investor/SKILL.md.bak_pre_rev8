> **Claude does NOT have persistent memory.** The values in this skills file are a COPY of master document, not a replacement. You MUST read the original before producing investor materials.

**BEFORE producing any investor-facing content with financial figures:**

1. **READ** the master document PDF: `Aurelian_VDR/02_Financial/2.4_Economic_Tables_Projections/02_Economic_Tables_Projections_REV6.pdf`
2. **READ** the design manual: `Design MAnual/aurelian-design-manual.md` (for formatting and styling rules)
3. **VERIFY** that values match what you actually read — not what you "remember".
4. **CONFIRM** the 17 checkpoint values from the master document.
5. **If you cannot read master document:** STOP and inform the user.

**This check applies for EACH document request within a conversation — not just the first one.**

### REFERENCE FORMAT FOR GENERATED DOCUMENTS (COPY — DO NOT RECONSTRUCT)

> **Rule: Never hardcode a revision number in generated documents (Word, PPT, PDF).** The master document is always the current revision. When a new revision is issued, all documents remain correct without needing updates. File paths retain the revision in the filename because that is the actual file on disk.

**Full reference:** `*02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04)`
**Inline with section:** `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §[number] (VDR 02.04)`

## COMPANY OVERVIEW

Aurelian Manufacturing is a pre-revenue Norwegian startup building Europe's first fully autonomous CNC manufacturing facility. Production as a Service — Autonomous, Data-Driven, and Scalable.

**Stage:** Pre-revenue (Aug 2027 production start)
**Location:** Valer, Ostfold, Norway (Norbygg facility partnership)
**Sector:** Industry 4.0 / Deep Tech / Advanced Manufacturing
**Org.nr:** 835 679 632
**Contact:** Andre Tandberg, CEO — andre@aurelian.no

## INVESTMENT THESIS

Three converging mega-trends create a once-in-a-generation opportunity:

1. **Defense Ramp-Up:** NATO nations committed to 5% GDP defense spending. Norway alone: 1,624 Billion NOK allocated 2025-2036. Bipartisan political support, multi-decade demand horizon.
2. **Energy Transition:** Offshore wind, O&G modernization, hydrogen/CCS, grid infrastructure — all require precision-machined components at scale.
3. **Structural CNC Capacity Gap:** Norwegian CNC shops average 20-45% utilization with ~2.5 staff per machine (CNC Benchmark, VDR 03.02). No domestic capacity exists to meet coming demand wave.

**Aurelian's approach:** Greenfield autonomous facility with design targets of 60-65% utilization at maturity and 0.8 FTE/CNC at scale — enabled by 24/7 autonomous scheduling, greenfield layout, and sub-linear staffing model. These are design targets for a pre-revenue company, structurally difficult for existing operations to replicate due to brownfield constraints.

## REVENUE MODEL & UNIT ECONOMICS

### Per-CNC Economics
- Theoretical hours: 8,760/year (24/7/365)
- Normalized hourly rate: NOK 3,000
- Revenue per CNC at 60% utilization: ~15.8 MNOK/year
- Revenue per CNC at 65% utilization: ~17.1 MNOK/year

### Revenue Projections (

| Year | Avg CNC | Avg Utilization | Revenue (MNOK) | Aurelian Profit (MNOK) | Staff |
|------|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| 2027 H2 | 5 | 20% | 10.9 | -2.5 | 8 |
| 2028 | 5 | 37.5% | 49.3 | 15.2 | 10 |
| 2029 | 12 | 42.5% | 134 | 72.9 | 14 |
| 2030 | 17 | 47.5% | 212 | 131.8 | 18 |
| 2031 | 20 | 52.5% | 276 | 166.8 | 20 |
| 2032 | 20 | 57.5% | 302 | 182.3 | 20 |
| 2033 | 22 | 60% | 347 | 207.0 | 22 |
| 2034 | 24 | 62.5% | 394 | 232.6 | 23 |
| 2035 | 25 | 65% | 427 | 247.8 | 24 |

**Sub-linear headcount growth:** 8 > 24 staff while CNC count grows 5 > 25

### Break-Even
- **Machine level:** ~24% utilization
- **Company level:** 5 CNC @ ~24% utilization (~31.5 MNOK revenue)
- Seed round funds exactly 5 CNC = matched to break-even configuration

### Cost Structure (Steady State, 20 CNC, 8% Variable Cost)
- Total cost: ~92.75 MNOK/year
- Variable costs: 8% of revenue (maturity curve from 13% in 2027)
- Personnel: 23.2 MNOK (17.6 operations + 5.6 admin)
- CNC depreciation: 25.0 MNOK
- Finance cost: 10.07 MNOK
- Facility lease: 5.2 MNOK

## 50/50 PROFIT-SHARING MODEL

**Mechanism:** Above 45% utilization threshold, marginal profit shared 50/50 with qualifying partnership customers.

**Why this is smart (not value-destroying):**
- Only applies to marginal upside above proven 45% threshold
- Customers below threshold pay standard market rates (100% to Aurelian)
- Creates customer lock-in and demand predictability
- Accumulated customer share (2031-2035): ~215 MNOK
- Accumulated Aurelian profit (2027-2035): ~1,254 MNOK
- Aurelian keeps the vast majority; customers get aligned incentives

## VALUATION DEFENSE

### Pre-Seed: 25 MNOK Pre-Money
- European Pre-Seed median: ~5-55 MNOK
- Justified by: Significant prep work, clear execution window, experienced founders, Industry 4.0 premium
- ROI: 46.6x (market expects 20-40x)

### Seed: 130 MNOK Pre-Money
- European Seed median: ~55 MNOK
- Aurelian at ~2.4x median, justified by:
  - Capital intensity (51.3 MNOK vs typical 2-5 MNOK software Seed)
  - Industry 4.0/Deep Tech premium (+170% YoY investment growth)
  - VC Method validation: 2.3B exit / required ROI / post-A dilution = Seed pre-money
- ROI: 10.8x (market expects 10-25x)

### Serie A: 250 MNOK Pre-Money
- European Series A median: ~390 MNOK
- Aurelian at 0.64x median = CONSERVATIVE
- At Serie A: 5 operational CNC, documented revenue (~49 MNOK), proven utilization, established customers
- ROI: 7.8x (market expects 5-10x)

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### Utilization Sensitivity (20 CNC, Steady State, 8% Variable)

| Utilization | Revenue (MNOK) | EBIT (MNOK) | EBIT Margin |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 20% | 105 | ~38 | ~36% |
| 30% | 158 | ~85 | ~54% |
| 40% | 210 | ~126 | ~60% |
| 50% | 263 | ~175 | ~67% |
| 60% | 315 | ~222 | ~71% |

**Key insight:** Extreme operating leverage. Every 10pp utilization increase = ~45-50 MNOK EBIT impact.

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Assumptions | Exit Value |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Bear Case | 45% util, 15 CNC by 2032 | 1.5B NOK (-35%) |
| Base Case | 60% util, 20 CNC by 2031 | 2.3B NOK |
| Bull Case | 65% util, 25 CNC by 2030 | 3.0B NOK (+30%) |

## STRUCTURAL POSITIONING

### Norwegian CNC Benchmark (Observed — VDR 03.02)

| Company | CNC | Utilization | Staff/CNC |
|---------|-----|------------|-----------|
| Rogaland Maskinering | 7 | 10% | 2.6 |
| Lilaas | 15 | 19% | 2.5 |
| Tamek | 8 | 20% | 2.5 |
| Aarbakke | 55 | 38% | 2.5 |
| Uvdal Maskinfabrikk | 11 | 37% | 2.5 |
| Ardal Maskinering | 18 | 47% | 2.5 |
| TP-Products | 14 | 40-45% | 2.5 |

**Aurelian design targets (pre-revenue):** 20 CNC, 60-65% utilization at maturity, 0.8 FTE/CNC at scale — enabled by greenfield autonomous design.

The design target of sub-linear staffing (0.8 FTE/CNC) requires layout, culture, IT/OT, and automation designed from scratch — structurally difficult for existing operations to retrofit.

### Why Brownfield Retrofit is Structurally Difficult
- Layout optimized for manned operation (not convertible to lights-out without rebuild)
- "One operator per machine" culture vs "one operator per cell of 3-5 machines"
- Legacy IT/OT systems with poor integration
- Cost to retrofit estimated as comparable to building new greenfield
- Innovator's dilemma: requires disrupting profitable current operations

### Hadrian Comparison (US)
- Hadrian: ~$1.6B valuation, US defense-focused autonomous CNC
- Validates global market appetite for this model
- Aurelian: European capital-disciplined answer — 101.3 MNOK total raise vs Hadrian's $200M+

## INVESTOR Q&A — TOP 15

**Q1: How do you justify valuations without revenue?**
A: VC Method derivation from 2.3B exit. Pre-Seed 46.6x ROI (above 20-40x market), Seed 10.8x (within 10-25x range), Serie A 7.8x (within 5-10x range). All rounds deliver market-competitive returns.

**Q2: What if you only achieve 40% utilization?**
A: Still profitable. Break-even is 5 CNC @ ~24%. At 5 CNC @ 40%, we generate ~52 MNOK revenue and ~15 MNOK EBIT. 60-65% is target based on validated benchmarks, but business case holds at materially lower utilization.

**Q3: Why won't incumbents copy you?**
A: Brownfield constraints. To match our economics, they'd need to rebuild facility, retrain workforce, replace legacy IT/OT, and change customer model. Combined cost = building new greenfield. By then we have 3-5 year head start + customer lock-in.

**Q4: How do you know 60-65% is achievable?**
A: Three sources: (1) DMG MORI + MAZAK reference installations, (2) Siemens digital twin case studies showing 80% process time reduction, (3) Industry OEE data — 60% is average for all manufacturing, 55-65% is competitive for HMLV, not exceptional.

**Q5: Doesn't 50/50 sharing hurt margins?**
A: No. Only applies to marginal upside above 45% threshold. Customers below threshold pay standard rates (100% to Aurelian). Accumulated Aurelian profit 2027-2035: 1,254 MNOK. The ~215 MNOK given to customers buys permanent demand lock-in.

**Q6: Why greenfield vs. acquiring an existing shop?**
A: The design target of sub-linear staffing (0.8 FTE/CNC at scale, vs observed industry ~2.5 per CNC Benchmark VDR 03.02) requires layout, culture, IT/OT architecture, and automation designed from scratch. Brownfield constraints make this structurally difficult to retrofit.

**Q7: What's your use of funds for the Seed round?**
A: 5 CNC machines (50 MNOK at 50% equity/50% debt) + 8.6 MNOK shop base setup + 10 MNOK operational buffer + 3 MNOK digital systems. Total deployment: 80.6 MNOK (51.3 equity + 29.3 debt).

**Q8: How do founders retain 50.6% through three rounds?**
A: Capital discipline. Total planned raise 101.3 MNOK equity vs comparable companies raising $200M+. Each round structured for minimum dilution while targeting competitive investor returns.

**Q9: What's the CNC resale value if things go wrong?**
A: MAZAK and DMG MORI are premium assets with strong secondary markets. 50-70% of CAPEX recoverable, providing significant downside protection for equity and debt investors.

**Q10: Who are your first customers?**
A: Target segments: Tier 1 Defense (Kongsberg, Nammo), Tier 2 Energy (Equinor, Aker Solutions), Tier 3 Maritime/Infrastructure. Leveraging Tore Ausland's 30+ year network for executive introductions. Physical Robotics LOI in progress. Customer LOIs are a priority gap being addressed.

**Q11: How does this compare to Hadrian?**
A: Hadrian (~$1.6B valuation) validates market appetite globally. Aurelian is the European capital-disciplined version — same autonomous CNC thesis, but 101.3 MNOK total equity raise vs $200M+, focused on European defense/energy markets.

**Q12: What are the key risks?**
A: (1) Equipment delivery delays (mitigated: order immediately post-Seed), (2) Customer acquisition timing (mitigated: Tore's network + anchor customer model), (3) Autonomous ramp-up speed (mitigated: gradual ramp with manned fallback), (4) Single facility concentration (mitigated: replicable platform model).

**Q13: What's the board structure?**
A: Pre-Seed: 3 seats (2 founders + 1 independent). Seed: 4-5 seats (add investor representatives). Serie A: 5 seats with proper governance framework.

**Q14: What quality certifications are planned?**
A: ISO 9001 (2027), AS9100 aerospace (2028), AQAP 2110 NATO (2028). Sequential approach — each certification unlocks new customer segments.

**Q15: What's the scaling model beyond Site Zero?**
A: Replicable platform. Same CNC, automation, and digital backbone for each new site. Expansion to DACH region, UK, France, Sweden — aligned with defense and industrial value chains. Each new site demand-anchored by strategic customers. ESOP at 10% per daughter company (site-level) — no dilution on parent.
