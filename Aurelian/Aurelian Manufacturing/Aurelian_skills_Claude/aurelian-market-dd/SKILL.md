## Market Thesis

Three structural mega-trends converge to create Aurelian's market opportunity:

1. **Defense ramp-up:** NATO pathway to 5% GDP by 2035. Norway's long-term defense plan: NOK 1,624 billion (2025-2036). This is multi-decade, bipartisan, and accelerating.

2. **Energy transition & industrial modernization:** Complex systems, compliance shifts, and supply chain reshoring are shifting value toward reliable, traceable, high-precision manufacturing.

3. **Structural CNC capacity gap:** European HMLV precision manufacturing capacity is insufficient. Skills shortage, aging workforce, and legacy workshop constraints create a supply-demand gap that widens each year.

**Hadrian signal:** A US company (founded 2020) reaching ~$1.6B valuation for automated CNC manufacturing validates investor appetite for this space. Aurelian addresses the same structural need in Europe with a different capital philosophy (101.3 MNOK total planned equity vs Hadrian's $200M+). Not a direct comparable, but relevant market validation.

## Competitive Landscape

### Norwegian CNC Benchmark Analysis

| Company | CNC | Utilization | Staff/CNC | Key Limitation |
|---------|-----|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Rogaland Maskinering | 7 | 10% | ~2.5 | Severe underutilization |
| Lilaas | 15 | 19% | ~2.5 | Low efficiency |
| Tamek | 8 | 20% | ~2.5 | Small scale |
| Uvdal Maskinfabrikk | 11 | 37% | ~2.5 | Traditional operations |
| Aarbakke | 55 | 38% | 2.5 | Largest, but brownfield limited |
| TP-Products | 14 | 40-45% | ~2.5 | Near ceiling for brownfield |
| Ardal Maskinering | 18 | 47% | 2.5 | Best traditional, still constrained |
**Aurelian design targets (pre-revenue):** 20 CNC, 60-65% utilization at maturity, 0.8 FTE/CNC at scale — enabled by greenfield autonomous design (24/7 scheduling, no legacy constraints).

### Structural Positioning

Aurelian's positioning is based on structural design choices, not incremental improvements:

1. **Sub-linear staffing model (design target 0.8 FTE/CNC at scale, vs observed ~2.5):** Requires building from scratch with autonomous design principles — structurally difficult to retrofit.

2. **Greenfield design window:** First mover in Nordic autonomous HMLV. Once established with certifications and customer relationships, switching costs are high for defense/energy customers.

3. **Digital thread:** Full traceability from raw material to finished part. Defense and aerospace customers increasingly require this — most existing operators lack integrated systems.

4. **Replicable platform:** Same blueprint designed for deployment across multiple locations. Existing operators' sites are each unique, which limits standardized scaling.

5. **Partnership model (50/50):** Profit-sharing above 45% utilization creates mutual incentive and natural customer stickiness.

### Why Brownfield Retrofit is Structurally Difficult

Replicating Aurelian's design approach would require incumbents to:
- Disrupt existing profitable operations
- Invest in completely new facilities
- Retrain or replace workforce
- Rebuild digital infrastructure from scratch
- Accept an estimated 2-3 years of disruption

This represents a classic innovator's dilemma in precision manufacturing.

## Customer Acquisition Strategy

### Anchor Customer Model

Aurelian targets 5-8 anchor customers who collectively provide >70% of initial capacity utilization:

**Target customer profile:**
- Defense prime contractors or Tier 1 suppliers
- Energy equipment manufacturers
- Maritime/offshore engineering companies
- Requires HMLV precision CNC with full traceability
- Values delivery security and capacity reservation

### 50/50 Profit-Sharing as Customer Acquisition Tool

The profit-sharing model above 45% utilization is not just economics — it's a go-to-market strategy:
- Aligns Aurelian's interests with customer's interests
- Incentivizes customers to provide consistent order flow
- Creates partnership dynamic rather than transactional relationship
- Reduces customer acquisition cost (attractive economics drive referrals)

### Go-to-Market Phases

**Phase 1 (Pre-Seed/Seed):** Leverage founders' industry networks. Tore Ausland: 30+ years oil & gas with GE, FMC, Aker. Secure LOIs from anchor customers. Physical Robotics LOI already in VDR.

**Phase 2 (Production start — Aug 2027):** Deliver first orders with 5 CNC. Exceptional quality and traceability. Begin ISO/AS9100 certification process.

**Phase 3 (Serie A Scale):** Scale to 20 CNC via 3x5 tranches. Leverage certifications to access restricted supply chains (defense primes). Expand to Nordic/European customers.

### Current Pipeline Status

**Physical Robotics LOI:** Exists in VDR — first anchor customer relationship.

**Priority gap:** Need 2-3 additional signed LOIs or MOUs from anchor customers before Seed close.

Founders have extensive industry networks:
- Andre Tandberg: Industrial funding ecosystem, SpareBank 1 network
- Tore Ausland: 30+ years with GE, FMC, Aker — direct relationships with Equinor, Hydro, Shell, BP supply chains
- Advisory board provides additional reach into industrial software (Bjornar Torsnes/CodeIT) and automation (Fredrik Vangsal/Disruptive Engineering)

## Market Timing — Why Now

Four factors converge to make 2026-2027 the optimal entry window:

1. **Defense CAPEX accelerating faster than supply:** NATO spending ramp-up is creating demand that existing workshops cannot absorb.

2. **Structural CNC capacity gap in Europe:** Aging workforce, insufficient investment, and growing demand create a widening supply gap.

3. **Autonomy now economically viable:** Technology maturity (MAZAK iSMART, DMG MORI CELOS X, Siemens digital twin) makes lights-out HMLV production practically achievable.

4. **Greenfield advantage before legacy players adapt:** Window to establish autonomous operations before incumbents attempt (and likely fail at) transformation.

## Market DD Q&A (Top 10)

**Q1: Who are your first 10 customers?**
A: Target: 5-8 anchor customers in defense and energy. Physical Robotics LOI in VDR. Founders' networks provide direct access to supply chains of Equinor, Hydro, defense primes. Additional customer LOIs in progress.

**Q2: Why won't incumbents replicate your model?**
A: Brownfield constraints make it structurally difficult to retrofit. Existing shops would need to disrupt profitable operations, rebuild facilities, retrain workforce, and accept years of disruption. This represents the classic innovator's dilemma in manufacturing.

**Q3: How do you know defense spending will continue?**
A: NATO spending targets are multi-decade, bipartisan commitments. Norway's 1,624 billion NOK plan (2025-2036) is legislated. Geopolitical drivers (Russia, China) strengthen rather than weaken this trend.

**Q4: What if the energy transition slows down?**
A: Aurelian is positioned across multiple sectors (defense, energy, industrial). Even if one sector slows, others provide demand. Defense alone justifies the capacity.

**Q5: What's your pricing strategy?**
A: 3,000 NOK/hour baseline (market rate for HMLV precision CNC in Norway), plus 50/50 profit sharing above 45% utilization. This creates competitive pricing while aligning incentives with customers.

**Q6: How big is the Hadrian comparison relevant?**
A: Hadrian validates investor appetite for automated precision manufacturing at ~$1.6B valuation. Aurelian addresses the same structural need in Europe with a more capital-disciplined approach (101.3 MNOK total equity vs $200M+). Not a direct comparable for valuation, but strong market validation.

**Q7: Can you really compete with low-cost countries?**
A: Aurelian doesn't compete on price — it competes on capability, traceability, delivery security, and proximity. Defense and energy customers require domestic/allied production, full documentation, and quality certifications that offshore cannot provide.

**Q8: What's the customer switching cost?**
A: High. Once qualified as a supplier (especially for defense), switching requires re-qualification (6-12 months), new process validation, and quality re-approval. Plus, 50/50 model creates economic incentive to stay.

**Q9: How do you handle customer concentration risk?**
A: Target 5-8 anchor customers, no single customer >30% of revenue. Diversification across defense, energy, and industrial segments provides natural hedging.

**Q10: What market research supports your TAM/SAM?**
A: Four dedicated market research reports (Defence, Energy, Critical Markets, Market Trends & Projections), 03 Market Trends & Projections (VDR 03.06), European VC benchmark analysis, and public data on NATO spending plans.
