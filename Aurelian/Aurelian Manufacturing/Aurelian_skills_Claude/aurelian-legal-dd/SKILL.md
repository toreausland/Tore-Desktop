# Aurelian Manufacturing — Legal DD

Corporate structure, governance, intellectual property, and legal compliance.

**All financial numbers from *02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04) — ABSOLUTE master.**

### REFERENCE FORMAT FOR GENERATED DOCUMENTS (COPY — DO NOT RECONSTRUCT)

> **Rule: Never hardcode a revision number in generated documents (Word, PPT, PDF).** The master document is always the current revision. When a new revision is issued, all documents remain correct without needing updates. File paths retain the revision in the filename because that is the actual file on disk.

**Full reference:** `*02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04)`
**Inline with section:** `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §[number] (VDR 02.04)`

❌ Never in generated docs: any revision number (e.g. "REV6", "REV7"), or "VDR 02.04" alone without document name
✅ In generated docs: "*02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04)" — NO revision number

**Examples with current values:**
- Revenue 20 CNC @ 60% = ~315 MNOK → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §5.1 (VDR 02.04)`
- Seed: 51.3 MNOK equity + 29.3 MNOK debt = 80.6 MNOK total → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §4.1 (VDR 02.04)`
- Staffing 20 CNC: 16 ops + 4 admin = 20 total → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §1.3b (VDR 02.04)`
- EBIT 20 CNC @ 60% = ~222.3 MNOK → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §3.6 (VDR 02.04)`

### MANDATORY: Pre-Work Check (applies to EACH document request)

Before creating or revising ANY document in this skill's scope:
1. **READ** the master document: `Aurelian_VDR/02_Financial/2.4_Economic_Tables_Projections/02_Economic_Tables_Projections_REV6.pdf`
2. **READ** the design manual: `Design MAnual/aurelian-design-manual.md`
3. **CONFIRM** the 17 checkpoint values from the master document
4. **This check applies for EACH document request within a conversation — not just the first one**
