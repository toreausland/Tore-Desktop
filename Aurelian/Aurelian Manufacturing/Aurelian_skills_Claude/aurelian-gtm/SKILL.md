# Aurelian Manufacturing — Go-to-Market Skill

## GTM MISSION

Take Aurelian Manufacturing from pre-revenue startup to production-ready facility with validated customer demand. Launch commercial activities March 2026, secure LOIs and pre-qualifications to fill 5 CNC machines at minimum 35% utilization by Q3 2027 (first production), achieving a solid first full operating year in 2028.

**Status:** Pre-revenue, pre-facility
**GTM Launch:** March 2026
**First Production:** August 2027
**First Full Year:** 2028 (target: minimum 37.5% machine park utilization per master document)
**Initial Capacity (Seed):** 5 CNC × 8,760 hours × 37.5% = ~16,425 billable hours needed
**Financial source:** *02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04) — ABSOLUTE master

### REFERENCE FORMAT FOR GENERATED DOCUMENTS (COPY — DO NOT RECONSTRUCT)

> **Rule: Never hardcode a revision number in generated documents (Word, PPT, PDF).** The master document is always the current revision. When a new revision is issued, all documents remain correct without needing updates. File paths retain the revision in the filename because that is the actual file on disk.

**Full reference:** `*02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04)`
**Inline with section:** `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §[number] (VDR 02.04)`

❌ Never in generated docs: any revision number (e.g. "REV6", "REV7"), or "VDR 02.04" alone without document name
✅ In generated docs: "*02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04)" — NO revision number

**Examples with current values:**
- Revenue 20 CNC @ 60% = ~315 MNOK → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §5.1 (VDR 02.04)`
- Seed: 51.3 MNOK equity + 29.3 MNOK debt = 80.6 MNOK total → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §4.1 (VDR 02.04)`
- Staffing 20 CNC: 16 ops + 4 admin = 20 total → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §1.3b (VDR 02.04)`
- EBIT 20 CNC @ 60% = ~222.3 MNOK → `Ref: 02 Economic Tables & Projections, §3.6 (VDR 02.04)`

### MANDATORY: Pre-Work Check (applies to EACH document request)

Before creating or revising ANY document in this skill's scope:
1. **READ** the master document: `Aurelian_VDR/02_Financial/2.4_Economic_Tables_Projections/02_Economic_Tables_Projections_REV6.pdf`
2. **READ** the design manual: `Design MAnual/aurelian-design-manual.md`
3. **CONFIRM** the 17 checkpoint values from the master document
4. **This check applies for EACH document request within a conversation — not just the first one**

## CONFIRMED COMMERCIAL TRACTION

### Signed LOI: Physical Robotics AS
- **Type:** Letter of Intent (signed)

## CERTIFICATION ROADMAP — CRITICAL PATH

| Certification | Start Prep | Target Achievement | Unlocks |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| ISO 9001:2015 | Q1 2026 (now!) | End 2027 | Baseline for all industrial customers |
| AS9100 Rev D | Q3 2027 | Q3 2028 | Aerospace/aviation customers |
| AQAP 2110 | Q3 2027 | Q3 2028 | NATO/defense contracts |
| ISO 14001 | 2029 | 2029 | Environmental management (differentiator) |
| ISO 45001 | 2029 | 2029 | OHS (differentiator) |
| Customer-specific | Ongoing | Ongoing | NAMMO, KDA, Equinor specific requirements |

**Critical insight:** ISO 9001 preparation must start NOW (Q1 2026) even without a facility. Documentation, procedures, and management systems can be built on paper and finalized during facility commissioning. Waiting until the facility is ready loses 12+ months.

**Certification Cost Estimates:**
- ISO 9001 initial: 100,000-200,000 NOK (consultancy + audit)
- AS9100 initial: 200,000-400,000 NOK (more complex, requires ISO 9001 first)
- AQAP 2110: 100,000-300,000 NOK (often done alongside AS9100)
- **Total: 400,000-900,000 NOK** — included in Pre-Seed use of funds
- **Potential funding:** Innovation Norway can subsidize 40-50% of certification costs

**LOI Target: 5-8 signed by end 2026**

## UTILIZATION BUILD-UP MODEL (

### 37.5% Target Validation (First Full Year 2028)

**Available capacity (5 CNC):** 5 × 8,760 = 43,800 theoretical hours
**At 37.5% utilization:** ~16,425 billable hours needed
**Revenue at 37.5%:** ~49.3 MNOK (NOK 3,000/hour) — per master document

**How to fill ~16,425 hours:**

| Customer Type | # Customers | Avg Hours/Customer | Total Hours | % of Target |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| Anchor (defense) | 2-3 | 3,000-5,000 | 6,000-15,000 | 37-60% |
| Energy/O&G | 2-3 | 2,000-3,000 | 4,000-9,000 | 24-40% |
| Robotics (Physical Robotics +) | 1-2 | 1,000-3,000 | 1,000-6,000 | 6-25% |
| Spot/other | 3-5 | 300-1,000 | 900-5,000 | 5-20% |
| **Total** | **8-13** | | **~16,425** | **100%** |

**Key insight:** 2-3 defense anchor customers can provide 37-60% of needed utilization. This is why defense is the #1 priority despite long sales cycles — we start now, they deliver volume at production start.

### CNC Scaling Beyond 2028 (

| Period | CNC | Utilization | Revenue (MNOK) |
|--------|-----|-------------|----------------|
| 2027 H2 | 5 | 20% | 10.9 |
| 2028 | 5 | 37.5% | 49.3 |
| 2029 | 12 (avg) | 42.5% | 134 |
| 2030 | 17 (avg) | 47.5% | 212 |
| 2031+ | 20 | 52.5%+ | 276+ |

Serie A adds 15 CNC in 3×5 tranches (operational Q1 2029, Q3 2029, Q3 2030).

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING FOR CUSTOMERS

## GTM Q&A — TOP 15

**Q1: Who is your first customer?**
A: Physical Robotics AS — a Norwegian humanoid robot company. We have a signed LOI. They need precision-machined components for robotic actuators, joints, and structural elements. Our advisory board member Andreas Mollatt is their CBDO, providing a strong relationship foundation.

**Q2: How will you get defense customers before you have certifications?**
A: Defense qualification is a multi-step process. We initiate pre-qualification dialogue in 2026 (capability presentations, paper-based assessments). Formal pre-qualification applications go in by mid-2026. Conditional supplier approval can happen before production start, with First Article Inspection as the production-readiness gate. Full AQAP 2110 and AS9100 certification targets 2028 — by which point we have 12+ months of quality track record.

**Q3: Why would NAMMO or KDA consider a startup supplier?**
A: Three reasons: (1) Norway's defense plan creates massive capacity demand — existing suppliers can't scale fast enough. (2) Our autonomous model provides capacity guarantee and surge readiness that traditional shops cannot match. (3) Norwegian ownership with no foreign control — a growing concern in defense supply chains. We're not asking them to replace existing suppliers — we're offering additional capacity they urgently need.

**Q4: What does the Physical Robotics LOI actually commit to?**
A: [NEED: Clarify LOI terms — currently signed but scope/volume not detailed in our records. Must define: estimated annual CNC hours, component families, timeline for first orders, quality requirements.]

**Q5: How do you reach 37.5% utilization in the first year?**
A: 37.5% of 5 CNC = ~16,425 hours (. We need 8-13 customers: 2-3 defense anchors providing 37-60% of volume, 2-3 energy customers providing 24-40%, and Physical Robotics + spot orders for the remainder. This is achievable because we start commercial activity 18 months before production — by Q3 2027 we should have firm orders, not just leads.

**Q6: What if defense qualification takes longer than expected?**
A: Our segments are diversified precisely for this reason. Energy/O&G has shorter qualification cycles (6-12 months). Physical Robotics is already committed. We can achieve 35% utilization from non-defense work alone, while defense pipeline matures for 2028-2029 full ramp.

**Q7: How does Tore's network translate to actual orders?**
A: Tore has 30+ years at GE, FMC, and Aker Solutions with direct executive relationships at Equinor, Hydro, Shell, and BP. In B2B manufacturing, relationships determine who gets on the approved supplier list. Tore's network provides: (1) direct access to decision-makers, (2) credibility as an experienced industry operator, (3) understanding of customer procurement processes from the inside.

**Q8: What's the sales cycle length by segment?**
A: Defense: 12-18 months from first meeting to first production order. Energy: 6-12 months. Robotics/industrial: 3-6 months. This is why we launch GTM in March 2026 — the defense pipeline needs the full 18 months to produce orders by Q3 2027.

**Q9: How much does GTM cost before production?**
A: [NEED: Prepare GTM budget. Estimated categories: Sales materials/website (100-200K NOK), industry events/travel (200-400K NOK), ISO 9001 certification process (100-200K NOK), CRM/tools (50-100K NOK), personnel time (covered in Pre-Seed operating budget). Total estimated: 500K-900K NOK, within Pre-Seed 5 MNOK allocation.]

**Q10: What KPIs do you track for GTM progress?**
A: Monthly tracking: (1) New qualified leads, (2) LOIs signed, (3) Pre-qualification applications submitted, (4) Estimated pipeline value (annual hours committed), (5) Conversion rate by stage, (6) Certification milestone progress. These feed directly into investor reporting.

**Q11: What's the 50/50 partnership model's role in GTM?**
A: The partnership model is NOT a lead-generation tool in Phase 1. It's a customer retention and volume-growth mechanism for Phase 2 (2029+) once we have proven quality. In Phase 1, we sell on capability, capacity, and quality. The 50/50 model becomes a competitive weapon once customers are qualified and volumes grow above the 45% utilization threshold.

**Q12: How do you handle the chicken-and-egg problem — no facility, no orders?**
A: This is standard for greenfield manufacturing. We solve it with: (1) LOIs that express intent, not require delivery. (2) Pre-qualification processes that evaluate capability, not current production. (3) Conditional purchase orders tied to facility readiness milestones. (4) Customer facility tours during construction to build confidence. (5) Digital twin demonstrations showing production capability. Every major CNC facility ever built faced this — the answer is always starting commercial dialogue early.

**Q13: Are there any government support programs for GTM?**
A: Several: Innovation Norway can subsidize 40-50% of certification costs (ISO/AS9100/AQAP). Forskningsrådet (Research Council) may fund technology development. Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) has industry partnership programs. EU defense industrial programs (EDIS/EDIP) are creating new supply chain funding. [NEED: Map specific programs and application timelines.]

**Q14: How do you avoid customer concentration risk?**
A: By design — we target 8-13 customers across 3-4 segments. No single customer should represent more than 25-30% of utilization. The 50/50 partnership model actually helps here: it attracts multiple medium-volume customers rather than one dominant customer, because the economic benefit scales with the customer's own volume growth.

**Q15: What happens if you only get 2-3 customers instead of 8-13?**
A: Our break-even is ~24% utilization on 5 CNC (. Even 2-3 customers providing 25% utilization makes us cash-flow positive. 37.5% is the target for a strong first year — not the minimum for survival. This low break-even provides substantial margin of safety for the GTM ramp.

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SKILLS
