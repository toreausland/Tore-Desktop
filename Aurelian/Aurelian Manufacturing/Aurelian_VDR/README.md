# Aurelian Manufacturing — Virtual Data Room Guide

## VDR Structure Overview

This is the investor-grade Virtual Data Room for Aurelian Manufacturing's fundraising process across Pre-Seed, Seed, and Series A rounds. The structure follows Nordic/European institutional VC standards.

**Current phase:** Seed round — 51.3 MNOK equity at 130 MNOK pre-money valuation.
**Master document:** *02 Economic Tables & Projections* (VDR 02.04) — the absolute source of truth for all financial numbers.
**Last updated:** 16 February 2026

---

## How This Structure Works

**Folders 00-07** are investor-facing — these are what you share via DocSend, Dropbox, or a dedicated VDR platform. They are numbered in the order investors typically review materials.

**Folder 08** is your internal DD war room — checklists, Q&A prep, investor tracking, and gap analysis. Never shared externally.

**Folder 09** contains appendices and deep-dive research. Shared selectively when investors request supporting evidence.

## Claude Code Integration

This VDR is designed to work directly with Claude Code. From your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the VDR
cd ~/Aurelian_VDR

# Ask Claude Code to work on specific sections
claude "Review the financial folder and identify what's missing for Seed"
claude "Draft an executive summary based on our master document and VDR materials"
claude "Create a Seed DD checklist and put it in 08_DD_Process_Internal/8.1_Checklists/"
```

The numbered folder structure means Claude Code can navigate intuitively and you always know exactly where things are.
