## The Opportunity

Norway faces a structural shortage of 39,000 skilled workers (NAV 2025), creating a persistent bottleneck in domestic manufacturing capacity. Demand from defense (NATO spending commitments), energy (transition and maintenance), and critical infrastructure continues to grow while the supply base struggles to scale.

Aurelian Manufacturing addresses this gap through a greenfield, technology-first approach: purpose-built facilities with progressive automation, enabling 24/7 production scheduling with a design target of 0.8 FTE per CNC machine at scale — compared to an industry-observed average of approximately 2.5 FTE per machine.

## What We Do

- Multi-axis CNC machining (3-axis through 5-axis simultaneous)
- Multi-tasking turn/mill operations
- Additive manufacturing and 3D metal printing services
- Complex geometries in steel, aluminum, titanium, and specialty alloys
- Full digital thread — order to delivery traceability and documentation
- Progressive automation toward lights-out operation capability
