## 1. Purpose

This Letter of Intent ("LOI") sets forth the mutual understanding between Aurelian Manufacturing AS ("Buyer") and Ravema AB ("Supplier") regarding the Buyer's intention to acquire CNC machine tools, shop base equipment, and automation systems for the Buyer's manufacturing facility in Valer, Ostfold, Norway.

This LOI is non-binding and does not create any legal obligation for either party to consummate the transactions described herein. It is intended to demonstrate the Buyer's serious commercial intent and to provide a framework for negotiating definitive purchase agreements.

## 2. Background

Aurelian Manufacturing is establishing a purpose-built autonomous CNC manufacturing facility in Valer, Ostfold, designed for high-mix, low-volume (HMLV) precision machining for defense, energy, and critical infrastructure customers. The facility is designed for progressive automation toward lights-out operation capability.

The Buyer has evaluated multiple CNC equipment suppliers and has selected Mazak machine tools, sourced through Ravema AB as the authorized Nordic distributor, as the preferred equipment platform for its initial facility configuration ("Site Zero").

---

## 3. Intended Equipment Scope

### 3.1 CNC Machine Tools — Site Zero (Seed Phase)

The Buyer intends to acquire approximately **5 CNC machine tools** for the initial facility configuration. The machine portfolio is expected to include a combination of:

- **Multi-tasking turn/mill centers** (e.g., Mazak INTEGREX series) — the primary production platform for complex, multi-operation parts
- **5-axis vertical machining centers** (e.g., Mazak CV5 series) — for prismatic and 5-axis work
- **Turning centers with live tooling** (e.g., Mazak QUICK TURN series) — for shaft and rotational components

The exact machine models, quantities, and option specifications will be defined in the definitive purchase agreement based on customer requirements and production planning.

All machines shall be configured with automation-ready options, including but not limited to:
- Robot interfaces (Ethernet/IP or equivalent)
- Automatic doors for automated loading/unloading
- In-process probing and tool measurement systems
- Machine connectivity (MT Connect, Mazak API, or equivalent)

### 3.2 Shop Base Setup

The Buyer intends to acquire support equipment for the initial facility, which may include:

- Metrology and quality assurance equipment (e.g., coordinate measuring machines, optical measurement systems)
- Material preparation equipment (e.g., bandsaws, material handling systems)
- Facility systems (e.g., compressed air, oil mist extraction, coolant management)

### 3.3 Automation Systems

The Buyer's facility is designed for progressive automation. Initial automation scope may include:

- Robot loading/unloading cells for individual machines or machine clusters
- Pallet systems for multi-machine automation
- Tool management and presetting systems
- Production monitoring and scheduling software integration

Automation systems may be sourced from Ravema AB, third-party automation integrators, or a combination thereof.
