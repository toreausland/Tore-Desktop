# Advisor Bios & Strategic Relevance

**Aurelian Manufacturing AS** | VDR 06.03 | February 2026 | CONFIDENTIAL

## 1. Advisory Board Overview

Aurelian Manufacturing has assembled a targeted advisory board of three individuals whose combined expertise spans the company's critical execution domains: technology and automation, industrial scaling, and growth capital. Each advisor brings direct, relevant experience to Aurelian's path from Seed funding through production start and commercial scale-up.

The advisory board operates in an informal capacity during the pre-Seed phase. Formal advisory agreements with defined scope, compensation, and terms are being established as part of the Seed round preparations.

## 2. Advisor Profiles

### 2.1 Fredrik Vangsal — Technology & Automation

**Advisory Focus:** CNC technology strategy, automation architecture, and manufacturing systems integration.

**Relevance to Aurelian:**
Fredrik brings hands-on expertise in industrial automation and technology integration — directly relevant to Aurelian's core thesis of autonomous CNC manufacturing. His advisory role supports:

- Evaluation and validation of CNC equipment selection and configuration
- Automation roadmap design — from semi-automated cells to progressive lights-out operation
- Technology stack assessment, including machine connectivity, digital thread architecture, and sensor integration
- Vendor and supplier relationship guidance in the Nordic automation ecosystem

**Why This Matters:**
Aurelian's differentiation depends on achieving significantly higher utilization rates than incumbent workshops through automation. Fredrik's technology perspective provides a practical reality check on automation feasibility, phasing, and integration risk — areas where pre-revenue companies often underestimate complexity.

### 2.2 Bjornar Torsnes — Industry & Scaling

**Advisory Focus:** Industrial operations, production scaling, and organizational development in manufacturing environments.

**Relevance to Aurelian:**
Bjornar's experience in scaling industrial operations provides Aurelian with practical guidance on the operational challenges of growing from a 5-machine Seed configuration to a 20-machine facility at scale. His advisory role supports:

- Operational process design and production workflow optimization
- Organizational scaling — transitioning from a founding team to a structured operations organization
- Quality management systems and certification pathways (ISO 9001, AS9100, AQAP 2110)
- Supply chain development and customer onboarding processes for industrial manufacturing

**Why This Matters:**
The transition from facility commissioning to stable production is a critical execution phase. Bjornar's industrial scaling experience helps Aurelian anticipate and plan for the operational complexities that emerge when moving from planning to production — staffing ramp-up, quality system implementation, and customer qualification processes.

### 2.3 Andreas Mollatt — Capital & Scaleups

**Advisory Focus:** Fundraising strategy, investor relations, and financial structuring for growth-stage companies.

**Relevance to Aurelian:**
Andreas brings experience from the Nordic venture and growth capital ecosystem — directly relevant to Aurelian's three-round financing strategy (PreSeed, Seed, Serie A). His advisory role supports:

- Fundraising process design and investor targeting
- Valuation methodology and deal structuring
- Cap table management and dilution planning across multiple rounds
- Investor communication, reporting frameworks, and board governance best practices

**Why This Matters:**
Aurelian's financing plan spans 101.3 MNOK in total equity across three rounds, supplemented by bank debt. Navigating this multi-round process — particularly the transition from Seed to Serie A — requires experience with Nordic VC practices, institutional investor expectations, and the specific dynamics of capital-intensive hardware startups.

## 3. Advisory Board Composition Rationale

The three advisory domains map directly to Aurelian's key execution risks and value creation drivers:

| Domain | Advisor | Aurelian Execution Area | Key Risk Addressed |
|--------|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Technology & Automation | Fredrik Vangsal | CNC configuration, automation roadmap, digital thread | Technical execution risk — can the automation targets be achieved? |
| Industry & Scaling | Bjornar Torsnes | Production operations, quality systems, organizational growth | Operational scaling risk — can the company grow from 5 to 20 machines efficiently? |
| Capital & Scaleups | Andreas Mollatt | Fundraising, investor relations, financial structuring | Financing risk — can the multi-round strategy be executed on timeline? |

This composition is intentional: each advisor addresses a distinct dimension of execution risk, with no overlap in expertise domains.

## 4. Advisory Engagement Status

| Advisor | Current Status | Formal Agreement |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Fredrik Vangsal | Active — informal advisory since founding | Pending (to be formalized at Seed) |
| Bjornar Torsnes | Active — informal advisory since founding | Pending (to be formalized at Seed) |
| Andreas Mollatt | Active — informal advisory since founding | Pending (to be formalized at Seed) |

Formal advisory agreements will define scope, time commitment, compensation (equity and/or cash), confidentiality obligations, and IP assignment terms. Draft agreements are being prepared as part of Seed round documentation (see VDR 05.02).
