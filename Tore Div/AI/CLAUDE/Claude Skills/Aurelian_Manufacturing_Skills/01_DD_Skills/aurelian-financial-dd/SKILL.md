# Aurelian Manufacturing — Financial DD

Pre-revenue financial validation and model defense. All numbers trace back to `Aurelian_Finansieringsplan_KOMPLETT.pdf` as master source.

## Critical Context

Aurelian is **pre-revenue** with Q3 2027 production start. Financial DD focuses on assumption validation, not historical performance. The financial model is built bottom-up from CNC machine economics.

## Revenue Model — Bottom-Up Build

The revenue model is built from individual CNC machine economics, not top-down market share assumptions.

### Unit Economics (Per CNC Machine)

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Available hours/year | 8,760 | 24h × 365d |
| Productive hours/year | 6,000 | ~68.5% theoretical availability |
| Target utilization | 60-65% | Validated (Vedlegg D) |
| Effective billable hours | 3,600-3,900 | 6,000 × utilization % |
| Revenue per hour | 3,000 NOK | Norwegian HMLV market rate |
| **Revenue per CNC/year** | **10.8-11.7 MNOK** | At 60-65% utilization |

### Revenue Scaling

| Year | CNC Count | Utilization | Revenue (MNOK) | EBIT (MNOK) |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| 2028 (Y1) | 8 | 35% | 50.4 | 15 |
| 2029 (Y2) | 8 | 50% | 72 | 35 |
| 2030 (Y3) | 15 | 55% | 148.5 | 85 |
| 2031 (Y4) | 20 | 60% | 216 | 130 |
| 2032 (Y5) | 20 | 65% | 234 | 145 |
| 2035 (Y8) | 25 | 65% | 315 | 222 |

### 50/50 Profit-Sharing Model

Above 45% utilization threshold, marginal profit is shared 50/50 with anchor customers. This is NOT a margin giveaway — it is an operational incentive driving customer stickiness.

**Cumulative effect (2028-2035):** Customers receive ~204 MNOK, Aurelian retains ~1,094 MNOK = **84% retained by Aurelian.**

The 45% threshold means baseline profitability is unaffected. The sharing only applies to marginal upside, incentivizing customers to provide consistent order flow.

## Break-Even Analysis

**Machine-level break-even:** 4 CNC @ 15-20% utilization = ~11-14 MNOK revenue. This is well below target, providing substantial downside protection.

**Scenario analysis:**

| Scenario | CNC | Utilization | Revenue | EBIT | Margin |
|----------|-----|-------------|---------|------|--------|
| Bear case | 8 | 30% | 43 MNOK | 8 MNOK | 19% |
| Conservative | 8 | 40% | 57 MNOK | 22 MNOK | 39% |
| Base case | 20 | 60% | 216 MNOK | 130 MNOK | 60% |
| Bull case | 25 | 65% | 315 MNOK | 222 MNOK | 70% |

**Key insight:** The business is profitable even at 30% utilization with 8 CNC machines. The sub-linear staffing model (0.8 people per CNC vs industry 2.5) means fixed costs stay low.

## Valuation Defense

### Why 140 MNOK Seed Pre-Money?

Three-factor justification:

1. **VC Method Derivation:** 2.3B exit ÷ 10x Seed ROI requirement ÷ post-Series A dilution = requires ~25% Seed ownership. 47 MNOK / 25% = 188 MNOK post-money → 140 MNOK pre-money. This is mathematically derived, not arbitrary.

2. **Capital Intensity Premium:** Manufacturing infrastructure requires 47 MNOK in Seed (vs typical SaaS 2-5 MNOK). Higher capital needs justify higher pre-money to maintain reasonable dilution.

3. **Industry 4.0 / Deep Tech Premium:** European early-stage investment in industrial robotics grew +170% YoY (2023). Deep tech companies reach unicorn status faster and generate 9x more patents.

### Comparison to European Market

| Round | EU Median 2025 | Aurelian Pre-Money | Ratio | Justification |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-------|---------------|
| Pre-Seed | €0.5-5M (~5-55 MNOK) | 25 MNOK | Mid-range | Significant prep work, Industry 4.0 |
| Seed | €5M (~55 MNOK) | 140 MNOK | 2.5x median | Capital-intensive, Deep Tech premium |
| Series A | €35.4M (~390 MNOK) | 250 MNOK | 0.64x median | Conservative — proven model discount |

**Note:** Series A is priced conservatively vs European median, providing attractive upside for later-stage investors.

## Exit Valuation

### EBITDA Multiple Selection

| Category | Multiple | Source |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Traditional Manufacturing | 6-8x | VC-Praksis analysis |
| Industrial IoT ($5-10M EBITDA) | 11.0x | VC-Praksis analysis |
| Aerospace & Defense (public) | 21.6x | VC-Praksis analysis |
| **Aurelian (used)** | **10-11x** | Conservative (Industrial IoT range) |

### Exit Calculation

- EBITDA 2035: ~245 MNOK (after 50/50 sharing)
- Multiple: 10x (conservative end of IoT range)
- **Exit value: 2.45 Billion NOK**
- **Used 2.3B NOK for all calculations = additional conservatism**

## CNC Resale Value (Downside Protection)

Per Vedlegg E analysis, MAZAK and DMG MORI CNC machines are premium assets with strong resale values:

- **Brand positioning:** Top-tier globally, high demand in secondary market
- **Value retention:** Superior build quality, advanced technology, extensive service networks
- **Collateral quality:** High-quality, low-risk assets suitable as bank security
- **Comparison:** Significantly stronger resale than Haas, comparable to Okuma

This means even in a total failure scenario, ~50-70% of machine CAPEX is recoverable through resale, substantially de-risking the lending position.

## Comparable Investment Cases (Vedlegg C)

### Hadrian (USA) — Market Validation

Hadrian was founded in 2020 to industrialize CNC precision manufacturing for defense/aerospace. Achieved ~$1.6B valuation with backing from T. Rowe Price and a16z. This validates that significant investor appetite exists for automated precision manufacturing in strategic sectors.

**Structural comparison:**

| Dimension | Hadrian (USA) | Aurelian (Europe) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Core | Automated CNC | Autonomous CNC |
| Primary segment | Defense/Aerospace/Space | Defense/Energy/Maritime |
| Production logic | Factory-as-a-Service | Autonomous HMLV platform |
| Staffing | Scalable, relatively high | Sub-linear (0.8 per CNC) |
| Capital model | Venture-funded growth | Capital-disciplined, industrial |
| Geography | USA (DoD-driven) | Nordics/Europe (regional resilience) |

**Key takeaway:** Aurelian is not a Hadrian copy — it is a European, capital-disciplined answer to the same structural need. The investment logic is validated by the market, even though execution strategy differs.

## Financial DD Q&A (Top 20)

**Q1: How do you justify 2.5x over European Seed median valuation?**
A: Three factors: (1) Capital intensity — 47 MNOK Seed vs typical 2-5 MNOK, (2) Industry 4.0 premium — deep tech +170% YoY investment growth, (3) VC Method — mathematically derived from exit/ROI/dilution.

**Q2: What if you only achieve 40% utilization?**
A: Still profitable. At 8 CNC @ 40%: 57 MNOK revenue, 22 MNOK EBIT. At 20 CNC @ 40%: 144 MNOK revenue, 75 MNOK EBIT. Break-even is 4 CNC @ 15-20%.

**Q3: How do you defend 3,000 NOK/hour pricing?**
A: Market rate for HMLV precision CNC in Norway. Verified against comparable operators (Aarbakke, Årdal Maskinering). Premium justified by full traceability, autonomous quality control, and defense/energy certifications.

**Q4: When do you break even?**
A: Machine-level at 4 CNC @ 15-20% utilization (~11-14 MNOK). Company-level estimated within 12-18 months of production start at target ramp-up.

**Q5: Does the 50/50 profit-sharing destroy your margins?**
A: No. Only applies to marginal upside above 45% utilization. Baseline profitability unaffected. Cumulative: customers get 204 MNOK, Aurelian keeps 1,094 MNOK (84%).

**Q6: What are your key financial risks?**
A: (1) Ramp-up slower than planned — mitigated by low break-even, (2) Utilization below target — profitable at 30%+, (3) Customer concentration — targeting 5+ anchor customers, (4) CAPEX overrun — phased investment, proven equipment.

**Q7: Why not self-fund or use bank debt only?**
A: CNC equipment qualifies for asset-backed lending, but equity is needed for: facility buildout, digital infrastructure, certification costs, working capital buffer, and team building. Blended financing reduces cost of capital.

**Q8: What's the IRR on machine investments?**
A: Driven by 24/7 operation without proportional labor cost. Even conservative scenarios show positive IRR early in machine lifetime. At target utilization, payback period is 12-19 months per CNC.

**Q9: How does capital productivity compare to peers?**
A: ROCE significantly higher due to sub-linear staffing. Traditional shops: 2.5 staff per CNC. Aurelian: 0.8. Same machine investment, 3x lower labor cost = dramatically higher capital productivity.

**Q10: What are your cost assumptions?**
A: Fixed costs dominated by facility lease (~4 MNOK/year), team (scaling from 6 to 19 people across ramp-up), and machine maintenance. Variable costs: tooling, materials, energy. Operating leverage is extreme due to autonomous operation.
