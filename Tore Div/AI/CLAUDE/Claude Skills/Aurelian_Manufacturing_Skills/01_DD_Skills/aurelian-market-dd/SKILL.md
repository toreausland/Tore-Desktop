# Aurelian Manufacturing — Market DD

Market sizing, competitive validation, and strategic positioning for autonomous HMLV CNC manufacturing. Primary sources: Markedsanalyse Master V3, Defence/Energy/Critical Markets Research, Market Trends & Projections, Vedlegg C.

## Market Thesis

Three structural mega-trends converge to create Aurelian's market opportunity:

1. **Defense ramp-up:** NATO pathway to 5% GDP by 2035. Norway's long-term defense plan: NOK 1,624 billion (2025-2036). This is multi-decade, bipartisan, and accelerating.

2. **Energy transition & industrial modernization:** Complex systems, compliance shifts, and supply chain reshoring are shifting value toward reliable, traceable, high-precision manufacturing.

3. **Structural CNC capacity gap:** European HMLV precision manufacturing capacity is insufficient. Skills shortage, aging workforce, and legacy workshop constraints create a supply-demand gap that widens each year.

**Hadrian signal:** A US company (founded 2020) reaching ~$1.6B valuation for automated CNC manufacturing validates massive investor appetite for this space. Aurelian is the European answer to this structural need.

## Competitive Landscape

### Norwegian CNC Benchmark Analysis

| Company | CNC | Utilization | Staff/CNC | Key Limitation |
|---------|-----|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Rogaland Maskinering | 7 | 10% | ~2.5 | Severe underutilization |
| Lilaas | 15 | 19% | ~2.5 | Low efficiency |
| Tamek | 8 | 20% | ~2.5 | Small scale |
| Uvdal Maskinfabrikk | 11 | 37% | ~2.5 | Traditional operations |
| Aarbakke | 55 | 38% | 2.5 | Largest, but brownfield limited |
| TP-Products | 14 | 40-45% | ~2.5 | Near ceiling for brownfield |
| Årdal Maskinering | 18 | 47% | 2.5 | Best traditional, still constrained |
| **Aurelian (target)** | **20** | **60-65%** | **0.8** | **Greenfield autonomous** |

### Competitive Moat

Aurelian's moat is structural, not incremental:

1. **3x labor efficiency (0.8 vs 2.5 staff/CNC):** Impossible to retrofit. Requires building from scratch with autonomous design principles.

2. **Greenfield advantage window:** First mover in Nordic autonomous HMLV. Once established with certifications and customer relationships, switching costs are very high for defense/energy customers.

3. **Digital thread:** Full traceability from raw material to finished part. Defense and aerospace customers increasingly require this — most competitors cannot provide it.

4. **Replicable platform:** Same blueprint can be deployed across multiple European locations. Competitors' sites are each unique, preventing standardized scaling.

5. **Customer lock-in through 50/50 model:** Profit-sharing above 45% utilization creates mutual incentive. Customers benefit from providing consistent order flow, creating natural stickiness.

### Why Incumbents Won't Catch Up

The competitive response to Aurelian requires incumbents to:
- Shut down existing profitable operations
- Invest in completely new facilities
- Retrain or replace entire workforce
- Rebuild digital infrastructure from scratch
- Accept 2-3 years of disruption

No rational management team will do this while current operations are generating revenue. This is the classic innovator's dilemma applied to precision manufacturing.

## Customer Acquisition Strategy

### Anchor Customer Model

Aurelian targets 5-8 anchor customers who collectively provide >70% of initial capacity utilization:

**Target customer profile:**
- Defense prime contractors or Tier 1 suppliers
- Energy equipment manufacturers
- Maritime/offshore engineering companies
- Requires HMLV precision CNC with full traceability
- Values delivery security and capacity reservation

### 50/50 Profit-Sharing as Customer Acquisition Tool

The profit-sharing model above 45% utilization is not just economics — it's a go-to-market strategy:
- Aligns Aurelian's interests with customer's interests
- Incentivizes customers to provide consistent order flow
- Creates partnership dynamic rather than transactional relationship
- Reduces customer acquisition cost (attractive economics drive referrals)

### Go-to-Market Phases

**Phase 1 (Pre-Seed/Seed):** Leverage founders' industry networks (Tore Ausland: 30+ years oil & gas with GE, FMC, Aker). Secure 2-3 LOIs from anchor customers. Target known-quantity prospects in defense and energy.

**Phase 2 (Production start):** Deliver first orders with exceptional quality and traceability. Use reference installations to expand customer base. Begin ISO/AS9100 certification process.

**Phase 3 (Scale):** Leverage certifications to access restricted supply chains (defense primes). Expand to Nordic/European customers. Build reputation as the autonomous HMLV benchmark.

### Current Pipeline Status

**GAP: Customer LOIs not yet documented.** This is the most critical gap for Seed DD. Need 2-3 signed LOIs or MOUs from potential anchor customers before Seed close.

Founders have extensive industry networks:
- André Tandberg: Industrial funding ecosystem, SpareBank 1 network
- Tore Ausland: 30+ years with GE, FMC, Aker — direct relationships with Equinor, Hydro, Shell, BP supply chains
- Advisory board provides additional reach into industrial software (Bjørnar Torsnes/CodeIT) and automation (Fredrik Vangsal/Disruptive Engineering)

## Market Timing — Why Now

Four factors converge to make 2026-2027 the optimal entry window:

1. **Defense CAPEX accelerating faster than supply:** NATO spending ramp-up is creating demand that existing workshops cannot absorb.

2. **Structural CNC capacity gap in Europe:** Aging workforce, insufficient investment, and growing demand create a widening supply gap.

3. **Autonomy now economically viable:** Technology maturity (MAZAK iSMART, DMG MORI CELOS X, Siemens digital twin) makes lights-out HMLV production practically achievable.

4. **Greenfield advantage before legacy players adapt:** Window to establish autonomous operations before incumbents attempt (and likely fail at) transformation.

## Market DD Q&A (Top 10)

**Q1: Who are your first 10 customers?**
A: Target: 5-8 anchor customers in defense and energy. Founders' networks provide direct access to supply chains of Equinor, Hydro, defense primes. Customer LOIs in progress. [Note: This is the key gap to close before Seed DD.]

**Q2: Why won't incumbents copy you?**
A: Brownfield constraints make it structurally impossible to retrofit. Existing shops would need to shut down, rebuild, retrain — no rational business would do this. It's the innovator's dilemma in manufacturing.

**Q3: How do you know defense spending will continue?**
A: NATO spending targets are multi-decade, bipartisan commitments. Norway's 1,624 billion NOK plan (2025-2036) is legislated. Geopolitical drivers (Russia, China) strengthen rather than weaken this trend.

**Q4: What if the energy transition slows down?**
A: Aurelian is positioned across multiple sectors (defense, energy, industrial). Even if one sector slows, others provide demand. Defense alone justifies the capacity.

**Q5: What's your pricing strategy?**
A: 3,000 NOK/hour baseline (market rate for HMLV precision CNC in Norway), plus 50/50 profit sharing above 45% utilization. This creates competitive pricing while aligning incentives with customers.

**Q6: How big is the Hadrian comparison relevant?**
A: Hadrian validates investor appetite for automated precision manufacturing at ~$1.6B valuation. Aurelian addresses the same structural need in Europe with a more capital-disciplined approach. Not a direct comparable for valuation, but strong market validation.

**Q7: Can you really compete with low-cost countries?**
A: Aurelian doesn't compete on price — it competes on capability, traceability, delivery security, and proximity. Defense and energy customers require domestic/allied production, full documentation, and quality certifications that offshore cannot provide.

**Q8: What's the customer switching cost?**
A: High. Once qualified as a supplier (especially for defense), switching requires re-qualification (6-12 months), new process validation, and quality re-approval. Plus, 50/50 model creates economic incentive to stay.

**Q9: How do you handle customer concentration risk?**
A: Target 5-8 anchor customers, no single customer >30% of revenue. Diversification across defense, energy, and industrial segments provides natural hedging.

**Q10: What market research supports your TAM/SAM?**
A: Four dedicated market research reports (Defence, Energy, Critical Markets, Market Trends & Projections), Markedsanalyse Master V3, European VC benchmark analysis, and public data on NATO spending plans.
