# Aurelian Manufacturing — Investor Materials Skill

## COMPANY OVERVIEW

Aurelian Manufacturing is a pre-revenue Norwegian startup building Europe's first fully autonomous CNC manufacturing facility. Production as a Service — Autonomous, Data-Driven, and Scalable.

**Stage:** Pre-revenue (Q3 2027 production start)
**Location:** Våler, Østfold, Norway (Norbygg facility partnership)
**Sector:** Industry 4.0 / Deep Tech / Advanced Manufacturing
**Contact:** André Tandberg, CEO — andre@aurelian.no

## INVESTMENT THESIS

Three converging mega-trends create a once-in-a-generation opportunity:

1. **Defense Ramp-Up:** NATO nations committed to 5% GDP defense spending. Norway alone: 1,624 Billion NOK allocated 2025-2036. Bipartisan political support, multi-decade demand horizon.
2. **Energy Transition:** Offshore wind, O&G modernization, hydrogen/CCS, grid infrastructure — all require precision-machined components at scale.
3. **Structural CNC Capacity Gap:** Norwegian CNC shops average 30-40% utilization with 2.5 staff per machine. No domestic capacity exists to meet coming demand wave.

**Aurelian's answer:** Greenfield autonomous facility achieving 60-65% utilization with 0.8 staff per CNC — a 3x labor efficiency advantage that is structurally impossible for incumbents to replicate.

### Capital Rounds

| Round | Ask (MNOK) | Pre-Money (MNOK) | Dilution | Purpose | Investor ROI |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Pre-Seed | 5 | 25 | 16.7% | Runway, agreements, IP | ~49x |
| Seed | 47 | 140 | 25.1% | Workshop + 8 CNC + buffer | ~10.5x |
| Series A | 42 | 250 | 14.4% | Scale to 20 CNC | ~7.9x |

**Total capital need:** 94 MNOK equity + ~113 MNOK debt = 207 MNOK total CAPEX

### Investor ROI vs. Market Expectations

| Round | European Market Expected | Aurelian Projected | Status |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Pre-Seed | 20-40x | ~49x | Above market |
| Seed | 10-25x | ~10.5x | Within range |
| Series A | 5-10x | ~7.9x | Strong |

### Exit Scenario
- **Exit valuation:** 2.3 Billion NOK
- **Multiple:** 10-11x EBITDA (conservative end of Industrial IoT range 6.9-11.1x)
- **EBIT at exit:** 222 MNOK (after 50/50 customer profit-sharing)
- **Timeline:** 2033-2035
- **Founders retain 53.4% at exit** — strong alignment

## CAP TABLE EVOLUTION

| Shareholder | Pre-Seed | Post-Seed | Post-Series A | Exit Value (MNOK) |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Eier A | 56.25% → 46.88% | 35.11% | 30.05% | 691 |
| Eier B | 33.75% → 28.13% | 21.07% | 18.03% | 415 |
| Eier C | 10.00% → 8.33% | 6.24% | 5.34% | 123 |
| Pre-Seed investors | 16.67% | 12.49% | 10.68% | 246 |
| Seed investors | — | 25.10% | 21.48% | 494 |
| Series A investors | — | — | 14.42% | 332 |

**Key message:** Founders retain majority (53.4%) through exit — unusual discipline for capital-intensive startup.

## REVENUE MODEL & UNIT ECONOMICS

### Per-CNC Economics
- Theoretical hours: 8,760/year (24/7/365)
- Normalized hourly rate: NOK 3,000
- Available production hours: ~6,000/year (maintenance, setup)
- Revenue per CNC at 60% utilization: ~10.8 MNOK/year
- Revenue per CNC at 65% utilization: ~11.7 MNOK/year

### Revenue Projections

| Year | Avg CNC | Avg Utilization | Revenue (MNOK) | EBIT (MNOK) | Staff |
|------|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| 2028 | 8 | 35% | 73 | 29 | 6 |
| 2029 | 11 | 40% | 116 | 60 | 10 |
| 2030 | 14 | 45% | 166 | 99 | 13 |
| 2031 | 20 | 50% | 263 | 150 | 16 |
| 2032 | 20 | 55% | 289 | 160 | 17 |
| 2033 | 22 | 57.5% | 333 | 190 | 18 |
| 2034 | 24 | 60% | 378 | 220 | 19 |
| 2035 | 25 | 65% | 427 | 245 | 20 |

**Sub-linear headcount growth:** 6 → 20 staff while CNC count grows 8 → 25

### Break-Even
- **Machine level:** 15-20% utilization
- **Company level:** 4 CNC @ 15-20% utilization (~11-14 MNOK revenue)
- Seed round includes 8 CNC = 2x safety margin on break-even

### Cost Structure (Steady State, 20 CNC)
- Fixed costs: ~102.5 MNOK/year
- Variable costs: 13% of revenue
- Personnel: 21.8 MNOK (17.6 operations + 4.2 admin)
- Depreciation: 16.0 MNOK
- Finance cost: 12.0 MNOK

## 50/50 PROFIT-SHARING MODEL

**Mechanism:** Above 45% utilization threshold, marginal profit shared 50/50 with qualifying partnership customers.

**Why this is smart (not value-destroying):**
- Only applies to marginal upside above proven 45% threshold
- Customers below threshold pay standard market rates (100% to Aurelian)
- Creates customer lock-in and demand predictability
- Accumulated customer share (2031-2035): ~204 MNOK
- Accumulated Aurelian profit (2028-2035): ~1,094 MNOK (84% of total)
- Aurelian keeps the vast majority; customers get aligned incentives

## VALUATION DEFENSE

### Pre-Seed: 25 MNOK Pre-Money
- European Pre-Seed median: €0.5-5M (~5-55 MNOK)
- Justified by: Significant prep work, clear execution window, experienced founders, Industry 4.0 premium
- ROI: 49x (market expects 20-40x) ✓

### Seed: 140 MNOK Pre-Money
- European Seed median: €5M (~55 MNOK)
- Aurelian at 2.5x median, justified by:
  - Capital intensity (47 MNOK vs typical 2-5 MNOK software Seed)
  - Industry 4.0/Deep Tech premium (+170% YoY investment growth)
  - VC Method validation: 2.3B exit ÷ 10x ROI ÷ post-A dilution = 25.1% needed at Seed → 140 MNOK pre-money
- ROI: 10.5x (market expects 10-25x) ✓

### Series A: 250 MNOK Pre-Money
- European Series A median: €35.4M (~390 MNOK)
- Aurelian at 0.64x median = CONSERVATIVE
- At Series A: 8 operational CNC, documented revenue (~95-116 MNOK), proven utilization, established customers
- ROI: 7.9x (market expects 5-10x) ✓

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### Utilization Sensitivity (20 CNC, Steady State)

| Utilization | Revenue (MNOK) | EBIT (MNOK) | EBIT Margin |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| 20% | 105 | 2.5 | 2.4% |
| 30% | 158 | 55.5 | 35.1% |
| 40% | 210 | 107.5 | 51.2% |
| 50% | 263 | 160.5 | 61.0% |
| 60% | 315 | 212.5 | 67.5% |

**Key insight:** Extreme operating leverage. Every 10pp utilization increase = ~50 MNOK EBIT impact.

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Assumptions | Exit Value |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Bear Case | 45% util, 15 CNC by 2032 | 1.5B NOK (-35%) |
| Base Case | 60% util, 20 CNC by 2031 | 2.3B NOK |
| Bull Case | 65% util, 25 CNC by 2030 | 3.0B NOK (+30%) |

## COMPETITIVE MOAT

### 7 Norwegian CNC Benchmarks

| Company | CNC | Utilization | Staff/CNC |
|---------|-----|------------|-----------|
| Rogaland Maskinering | 7 | 10% | 2.6 |
| Lilaas | 15 | 19% | 2.5 |
| Tamek | 8 | 20% | 2.5 |
| Aarbakke | 55 | 38% | 2.5 |
| Uvdal Maskinfabrikk | 11 | 37% | 2.5 |
| Årdal Maskinering | 18 | 47% | 2.5 |
| TP-Products | 14 | 40-45% | 2.5 |
| **Aurelian (target)** | **20** | **60-65%** | **0.8** |

**3x labor efficiency (0.8 vs 2.5 staff/CNC) is structurally impossible to retrofit.**

### Why Incumbents Cannot Catch Up
- Layout optimized for manned operation (cannot convert to lights-out)
- "One operator per machine" culture vs "one operator per cell of 3-5 machines"
- Legacy IT/OT systems with poor integration
- Cost to retrofit ≈ cost to build new greenfield
- Innovator's dilemma: requires shutting down profitable operations for 2-3 years

### Hadrian Comparison (US)
- Hadrian: $1.6B valuation, US defense-focused autonomous CNC
- Validates global market appetite for this model
- Aurelian: European capital-disciplined answer — 94 MNOK total raise vs Hadrian's $200M+

## INVESTOR Q&A — TOP 15

**Q1: How do you justify valuations without revenue?**
A: VC Method derivation from 2.3B exit. Pre-Seed 49x ROI (above 20-40x market), Seed 10.5x (within 10-25x range), Series A 7.9x (within 5-10x range). All rounds deliver market-competitive returns.

**Q2: What if you only achieve 40% utilization?**
A: Still profitable. Break-even is 4 CNC @ 15-20%. At 8 CNC @ 40%, we generate 95 MNOK revenue and 35 MNOK EBIT. 60-65% is target based on validated benchmarks, but business case holds at materially lower utilization.

**Q3: Why won't incumbents copy you?**
A: Brownfield constraints. To match our economics, they'd need to rebuild facility, retrain workforce, replace legacy IT/OT, and change customer model. Combined cost ≈ building new greenfield. By then we have 3-5 year head start + customer lock-in.

**Q4: How do you know 60-65% is achievable?**
A: Three sources: (1) DMG MORI + MAZAK reference installations, (2) Siemens digital twin case studies showing 80% process time reduction, (3) Industry OEE data — 60% is average for all manufacturing, 55-65% is competitive for HMLV, not exceptional.

**Q5: Doesn't 50/50 sharing hurt margins?**
A: No. Only applies to marginal upside above 45% threshold. Customers below threshold pay standard rates (100% to Aurelian). Accumulated Aurelian profit 2028-2035: 1,094 MNOK (84% of total). The 204 MNOK given to customers buys permanent demand lock-in.

**Q6: Why greenfield vs. acquiring an existing shop?**
A: Sub-linear staffing (0.8 vs 2.5 per CNC) is impossible to retrofit. Layout, culture, IT/OT architecture, and automation all need to be designed from scratch for lights-out operation.

**Q7: What's your use of funds for the Seed round?**
A: 8 CNC machines + automation (40 MNOK at 50% equity/50% debt) + 7 MNOK operating buffer. Zero waste — every NOK goes to revenue-generating assets.

**Q8: How do founders retain 53.4% through three rounds?**
A: Capital discipline. Total raise 94 MNOK vs comparable companies raising 200M+. Each round optimized for minimum dilution while maintaining competitive investor returns.

**Q9: What's the CNC resale value if things go wrong?**
A: MAZAK and DMG MORI are premium assets with strong secondary markets. 50-70% of CAPEX recoverable, providing significant downside protection for equity and debt investors.

**Q10: Who are your first customers?**
A: Target segments: Tier 1 Defense (Kongsberg, Nammo), Tier 2 Energy (Equinor, Aker Solutions), Tier 3 Maritime/Infrastructure. Leveraging Tore Ausland's 30+ year network for executive introductions. Customer LOIs are a priority gap being addressed.

**Q11: How does this compare to Hadrian?**
A: Hadrian ($1.6B valuation) validates market appetite globally. Aurelian is the European capital-disciplined version — same autonomous CNC thesis, but 94 MNOK total raise vs $200M+, focused on European defense/energy markets.

**Q12: What are the key risks?**
A: (1) Equipment delivery delays (mitigated: order immediately post-Seed), (2) Customer acquisition timing (mitigated: Tore's network + anchor customer model), (3) Autonomous ramp-up speed (mitigated: gradual ramp with manned fallback), (4) Single facility concentration (mitigated: replicable platform model).

**Q13: What's the board structure?**
A: Pre-Seed: 3 seats (2 founders + 1 independent). Seed: 4-5 seats (add investor representatives). Series A: 5 seats with proper governance framework.

**Q14: What quality certifications are planned?**
A: ISO 9001 (2027), AS9100 aerospace (2028), AQAP 2110 NATO (2028). Sequential approach — each certification unlocks new customer segments.

**Q15: What's the scaling model beyond Site Zero?**
A: Replicable platform. Same CNC, automation, and digital backbone for each new site. Expansion to DACH region, UK, France, Sweden — aligned with defense and industrial value chains. Each new site demand-anchored by strategic customers.
