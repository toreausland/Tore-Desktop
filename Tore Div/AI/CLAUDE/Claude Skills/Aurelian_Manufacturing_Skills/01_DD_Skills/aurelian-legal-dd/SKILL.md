## Intellectual Property

### IP Strategy: Trade Secrets Over Patents

More practical for manufacturing — process know-how is the real competitive advantage.

| IP Asset | Protection | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Operational processes | Trade secret | In development |
| Digital twin models | Trade secret | In development |
| Quality procedures | Trade secret | In development |
| Facility layout designs | Trade secret | Designed |
| Brand name + logo | Trademark | GAP: Need registration |
| Documentation | Copyright | In development |
| Software (if proprietary) | Copyright | TBD |

**Critical GAP:** IP assignment agreements not yet executed. All team members and advisors must sign before Seed close.

## Material Contracts Status

| Contract | Counterparty | Status | Priority |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Facility lease | Norbygg | Referenced, terms pending | HIGH |
| CNC purchase LOI | MAZAK | Referenced, not documented | HIGH |
| Customer LOIs | TBD | Not started | CRITICAL |
| Shareholder agreement | Founders | GAP | CRITICAL |
| Founder vesting | Internal | GAP | HIGH |
| Employment agreements | Internal | GAP | HIGH |
| Advisory agreements | Advisors | GAP | MEDIUM |
