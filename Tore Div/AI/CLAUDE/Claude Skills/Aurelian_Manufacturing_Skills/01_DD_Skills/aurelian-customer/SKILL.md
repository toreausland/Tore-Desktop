## CUSTOMER-FACING Q&A — TOP 10

**Q1: When can you start delivering?**
A: First production capability Q3 2027. Pilot projects and supplier qualification can begin immediately upon facility commissioning. We recommend starting the onboarding process 6 months before to be ready for first delivery.

**Q2: What quality certifications will you have?**
A: ISO 9001:2015 targeted for 2027 (production start). AS9100 (aerospace) and AQAP 2110 (NATO) both targeted for 2028. We can work with customer-specific quality requirements from day one.

**Q3: How does the 50/50 profit-sharing work in practice?**
A: Simple. Below 45% utilization threshold — standard pricing, nothing changes. Above 45% — the marginal profit on your orders is shared equally. You get automatic volume rebates. No complicated formulas — just transparent cost sharing that rewards your loyalty.

**Q4: Can you handle defense/classified work?**
A: Our facility is designed for defense-grade requirements. Norwegian ownership, security-clearable workforce, full digital traceability, and AQAP 2110 certification planned. No foreign ownership concerns. We are building implicit preparedness value — qualified capacity ready when you need it.

**Q5: What materials can you machine?**
A: Full range of metals: steel, stainless steel (including duplex/super duplex), aluminum (all grades), titanium (Grade 2, 5, 23), Inconel, Hastelloy, and specialty alloys. We source from certified Norwegian and European suppliers with full material traceability.

**Q6: How do your prices compare?**
A: Our normalized rate of NOK 3,000/hour is competitive with the Norwegian market. Where we differentiate: (1) Partnership customers get volume-based savings of 10-14%, (2) Our higher utilization means lower overhead per part, (3) 24/7 operation means faster delivery. For offshore alternatives, we're slightly higher on pure price but dramatically better on lead time, IP protection, and compliance.

**Q7: What if I need to scale volume quickly?**
A: Our autonomous operation model means capacity scales without proportional staffing increases. We can add shifts (already 24/7 capable) or allocate additional machines to your work. Partnership customers get priority access to expansion capacity.

**Q8: How do you ensure quality consistency in lights-out operation?**
A: Multiple layers: (1) Digital twin validates every program before cutting, (2) In-process monitoring with automated SPC, (3) CMM measurement integrated into production flow, (4) Complete digital traceability — every parameter logged and auditable. Autonomous ≠ unmonitored. It means digitally monitored 24/7.

**Q9: Can you handle prototypes and development work?**
A: Yes. Our offline programming and digital twin capabilities mean fast turnaround on new parts. We can go from 3D model to first article in days, not weeks. Competitive prototype pricing, and if your product moves to production, you're already qualified.

**Q10: Why should I switch from my current supplier?**
A: Three reasons: (1) Capacity security — your current supplier likely operates at 30-40% utilization on single shift, meaning any demand spike delays your orders. We operate 24/7 with 60-65% utilization. (2) Cost trajectory — our partnership model means your costs decrease as volume grows. (3) Future-proofing — full digital traceability, defense compliance, and Norwegian supply chain security increasingly required by your end customers.

## COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES

When communicating with customers:

**Tone:** Professional, technically confident, solution-oriented
**Language:** Norwegian for domestic customers, English for international
**Focus areas:**
- Lead with capability and capacity (what we can do for them)
- Present partnership model as optional benefit (not pressure)
- Emphasize Norwegian production, supply chain security
- Quality systems and traceability as differentiators
- Defense/energy sector expertise and compliance

**Avoid:**
- Discussing internal financial projections or investor information
- Sharing cap table or ownership details (refer to CEO)
- Making delivery commitments before production start (Q3 2027)
- Promising specific certifications before achieved (say "planned" or "targeted")
- Discussing other customer volumes or pricing (confidential)
