### 3. Design Principles

**Visual Requirements:**

- NO text-only slides

- Two-column layouts for complex information
- Icon + text rows for processes or lists
- Strong contrast for readability
- Consistent spacing (0.5" margins minimum)
- NO accent lines under titles (avoid AI design clichés)

**Typography:**
- Header font: Something with personality (Georgia, Cambria, Trebuchet MS)
- Body font: Clean and readable (Calibri or Calibri Light)
- Slide titles: 36-44pt bold
- Section headers: 20-24pt bold
- Body text: 14-16pt
- Captions/sources: 10-12pt in muted color

**Color Usage:**

- Use color strategically to highlight key information
- Avoid over-saturation

**Data Visualization:**

### 4. Content Quality Standards

- Visionary yet grounded in concrete metrics

**Financial Rigor:**
