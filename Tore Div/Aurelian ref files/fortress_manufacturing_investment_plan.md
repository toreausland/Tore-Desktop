# Fortress Manufacturing Investment Plan
## Executive Summary

This document presents the complete investment plan for Fortress Manufacturing, a state-of-the-art precision manufacturing facility to be established in Våler in Østfold, Norway. Based on the Hadrian Manufacturing approach, the facility will feature three specialized Production-On-Demand (POD) manufacturing cells within a 5,000 square meter manufacturing floor, plus 3,000 square meters of office space.

The total investment required is **536,250,000 NOK** (approximately €48.75 million or $53.63 million), implemented over a 30-month period. The pre-seed funding requirement is 25,000,000 NOK, which will enable the critical first phase of the project including detailed engineering, permitting, and initial procurement activities.

This investment will establish Fortress Manufacturing as a leading provider of precision components for the offshore, aerospace, and defense industries in Europe, leveraging the strategic location of Våler in Østfold as a logistics hub with excellent access to road, railway, and marine transport.

## Strategic Vision

Fortress Manufacturing will revolutionize precision component manufacturing in Scandinavia by implementing the Hadrian Manufacturing approach of highly automated, flexible Production-On-Demand (POD) cells. The facility will deliver components 10x faster and at half the cost of traditional manufacturers while meeting the highest quality standards for offshore, airforce, and military applications in Europe.

### Key Strategic Elements:
- **Location Advantage**: Våler in Østfold provides strategic access to European markets and excellent logistics infrastructure
- **POD Manufacturing Approach**: Flexible, automated manufacturing cells that can be rapidly reconfigured for different component types
- **Digital Integration**: Comprehensive digital twin implementation for simulation, optimization, and process control
- **Quality Focus**: Meeting the stringent requirements of NORSOK (offshore), AS/EN 9100 (aerospace), and NATO STANAG (defense) standards
- **Phased Implementation**: Staged approach to minimize risk while enabling early production capability
