- Phased commissioning approach to validate systems incrementally
- Comprehensive training program starting before equipment arrival

### Risk Factors and Mitigation
- Equipment delivery delays: Early procurement and contractual safeguards
- Integration challenges: Detailed interface management and digital twin simulation
- Skilled labor availability: Early recruitment and training partnerships
- Regulatory compliance: Proactive engagement with authorities

### Value Engineering Opportunities
- Concurrent engineering and construction activities

## Summary
The total implementation and installation cost for the Fortress Manufacturing facility is estimated at 174,850,000 NOK, representing approximately 48% of the total project investment. This comprehensive implementation budget covers all aspects of bringing the facility online, from project management and engineering through equipment installation, training, and production ramp-up.

The implementation is structured in four phases over a 30-month period, allowing for a staged approach that minimizes risk while enabling the earliest possible start of production in POD 1. This phased approach also allows for lessons learned in early phases to be applied to subsequent phases, improving efficiency and reducing risk.
