2. **Reliability**: Ultra-reliable scheduling and capacity management through advanced factory operating systems
3. **Cost Efficiency**: >40% more efficient than legacy manufacturing, halving the cost of making components
4. **Transparency**: Real-time visibility of parts in factory and supply chain, from FAI to Final
5. **Quality**: AS9100 certified, meeting the highest standards for aerospace and defense

### Target Markets
- Space industry (rockets, satellites)
- Defense industry (jets, drones)
- Future expansion into Semiconductor, Energy, and Medical Devices

### Revenue Model
- Manufacturing precision metal components for aerospace, space, and defense companies
- Scaling through a network of standardized, cookie-cutter factories across the country
- Focusing on high-margin, high-precision components that require specialized manufacturing capabilities

## Operational Approach

### Manufacturing Strategy
1. **Factory Network**: Building multiple standardized, high-tech machine shops across the country
2. **Vertical Integration**: NPI (New Product Introduction) & Production under one roof
3. **Material Capabilities**:
   - Currently: Aluminum (AL 7075 & 6061 stocked at all times)
   - Launching soon: Steel, Titanium & Inconel capabilities
4. **Technical Capabilities**:
   - High Precision, 5-Axis Milling
   - Common OSP & Insert types supported
   - Scalable capacity to handle aggressive program ramps

### Technology Integration
1. **Proprietary Software**: Developed in-house to run factory operations
2. **Advanced Scheduling**: Capacity management and factory operating system
3. **Automation**: Reducing labor requirements while increasing precision and speed
4. **Simplified Systems**: Enabling operators with zero machining experience to produce spaceflight grade hardware with less than 60 days of training

### Expansion Strategy
1. **Factory Scaling**: Started with Factory 1 in Hawthorne, LA; launching Factory 2 (5x larger) in Torrance, LA
2. **Material Expansion**: Adding capabilities for steels and other hard metals
3. **Geographic Growth**: Plans for country-wide expansion
4. **Capacity Scaling**: Building infrastructure to handle billions in revenue capacity
