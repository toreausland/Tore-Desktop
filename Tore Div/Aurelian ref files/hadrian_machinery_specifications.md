   - Robotic loading/unloading
   - Automated inspection and quality control
   - Centralized tool management

3. **Digital Integration**
   - Proprietary factory operating system
   - Real-time monitoring and data collection
   - Digital work instructions
   - Predictive maintenance systems

4. **Process Specialization**
   - PODs specialized for specific material types (aluminum, steel, titanium)
   - PODs configured for specific component families
   - Optimized for specific manufacturing processes
