## Cash Runway Analysis

### Pre-Seed Funding Target
**NOK 25,000,000 ($2,300,000)**

This pre-seed funding amount is designed to cover:
- All expenses through Phases 1-4 (NOK 20,000,000)
- Initial Phase 5 expenses to demonstrate progress (NOK 5,000,000)

### Subsequent Funding Requirements
To complete the full implementation of Phase 5, the company will require:
- Seed Round: NOK 50,000,000 ($4,600,000)
- Series A: NOK 35,000,000 ($3,230,000)

### Cash Runway
- **Pre-Seed to Seed**: 12 months
- **Seed to Series A**: 12-18 months

## Capital Efficiency Strategies

1. **Phased Equipment Acquisition**
   - Start with essential machines to demonstrate capabilities
   - Add capacity as production demands increase
   - Leverage supplier financing where available

2. **Facility Development Approach**
   - Begin with core 5,000 square meter facility
   - Design for modular expansion to second 5,000 square meter phase
   - Optimize initial layout for maximum efficiency with minimal equipment

3. **Strategic Partnerships**
   - Explore equipment leasing options to reduce upfront capital
   - Consider joint ventures for specialized capabilities
   - Leverage supplier demonstration equipment where possible

4. **Government Support**
   - Apply for Norwegian industrial development grants
   - Explore tax incentives for manufacturing investments
   - Investigate EU funding for advanced manufacturing

## Risk Mitigation for Capital Planning

1. **Contingency Allocation**
   - 5% overall contingency (NOK 6,000,000)
   - Higher contingency percentages for early phases
   - Separate contingencies for construction and equipment

2. **Flexible Implementation**
   - Identify non-critical elements that can be deferred
   - Develop alternative scenarios for different funding outcomes
   - Create modular implementation plan that can scale with available capital

3. **Cash Conservation Measures**
   - Founding team compensation structured with equity components
   - Temporary facilities until permanent location is ready
   - Careful staging of hires to match actual needs

## Conclusion

The capital requirements outlined in this document represent a comprehensive assessment of the funding needed to bring Project Aurelian from concept to pre-seed funding completion and initial implementation. The total capital requirement of NOK 110,000,000 ($10,160,000) reflects the significant investment needed to establish a state-of-the-art precision manufacturing facility based on the Hadrian model.

The pre-seed funding target of NOK 25,000,000 ($2,300,000) is designed to cover all expenses through the pre-seed funding phase and initial implementation, providing sufficient runway to demonstrate the concept's viability and prepare for subsequent funding rounds.

This capital plan is structured to maximize efficiency and minimize risk, with a phased approach to implementation that allows for adjustments based on actual progress and funding outcomes.
